HA Cluster Bootstrap
====================

Tools to bootstrap a Pacemaker High Availability cluster in a hurry.

* ha-cluster-init
  Installs and configures the first node in a new cluster.

* ha-cluster-join
  Installs and configures new nodes to join the cluster.

* ha-cluster-remove
  Removes a node from the cluster.

NOTE: This tool is most likely to work best on a SUSE-based 
distribution (SLE or openSUSE). Patches to make it cross-
platform compatible are welcomed.
